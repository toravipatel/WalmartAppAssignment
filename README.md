Area of Improvement

1 - Below scenario is not implemented properly.
Given: The user has not seen the APOD page today AND the phone is not connected to the
internet When: The user arrives at the APOD page Then: The page should display an error
"We are not connected to the internet, showing you the last image we have." AND The page
should display the image of Astronomy Picture of the Day along with the title and explanation,
that was last seen by the user

2 - Still UI can improved.
